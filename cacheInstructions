Instructions

  To get these results, I compiled the source code 'caching.c' using command
  'gcc -g -o caching caching.c' on my terminal. Then, I made sure the small and
  large files were in the same folder directory as my compiled source code. I then ran the
  command './caching<small' and './caching<large' to get my results. I made sure to print out
  the hits and misses in my source code for each cache implementation to make the results more
  readable. The results are seen in my cacheResults file.
